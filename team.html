                    <p>Owner - Wilton Plumbing</p>
                    <p>B.A. (University of Cape Town 2007)</p>
                    <p>Qualified plumber (CETA Certificate 2010)</p>
                    <p>I love working with my hands. I grew up helping my father in his workshop from an early age,
                        helping him to fix his motorbikes, boats and various other DIY projects.</p>
                    <p>While completing my BA Degree at UCT (majoring in Sociology and English) in 2007, I realized that
                        my passion was, in fact, to be a plumber! I then dedicated myself to mastering plumbing and have
                        been active in the trade for the past eight years.</p>
                    <p>After a two year apprenticeship at a well-established and respected plumbing company in Cape
                        Town, I qualified as a plumber, staying on to gain experience for a further five years.</p>
                    <p>I have now launched my own company and am excited, and eager to be at hand for whatever your
                        plumbing needs may be!</p>
                    <p>I give a six month guarantee on every job.</p>
                    <p>Try me. You wonâ€™t be sorry!</p>
